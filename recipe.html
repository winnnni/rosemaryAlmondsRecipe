				Add 2 tablespoons of the rosemary and 2 teaspoons of salt and toss again.</p>

				Spread the nuts in one layer. Roast for 25 minutes, stirring twice with a large metal spatula, until the nuts are glazed and golden brown. 
				Remove from the oven and sprinkle with 2 more teaspoons of salt and the remaining 2 tablespoons of rosemary. 
				Toss well and set aside at room temperature, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking as they cool. 
				Taste for seasoning. 
				Serve warm or cool completely and store in airtight containers at room temperature for up to a week.
